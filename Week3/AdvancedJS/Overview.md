# Office Hours
    - Q & A
    - Lets look over the assignment I gave last week if you have it. 
    - Break

# Lecture - Advanced JS

## const & let - ES6
    - const - cannot be changed and is scoped within its block
    - let - also block scoped
## Conditionals
    - logical operators
        - && (and)
        - || (or)
        - ! (not)
        - == (equals value)
        - === (equal value & Data Type)

    - if, else if, else

## Objects - {}
    - Everything in JS is an Object
    - key/value pairs {key:value, key:value, key:value};
    - dot and bracket notation
    - getting value from object
    - changing values
    - adding keys
    - deleting keys

## Arrays
    - indexes
    - length
    - push()
    - pop()
    - getting value by index
    - changing value AT index

## For Loops
    - Used to execute code a specified number of times
    - Anatomy
        - for keyword
        - start position
        - condition for continuin to loop
        - end action (what happens at the end of each loop)
    - break
    - continue

## While Loops
    - used to continuously run until a certain condition is no longer met
    - Anatomy
        - while keyword
        - condition for continuing the loop
    - break and continue still work here but break is more common
    - parameters must be set outside of the loop (var i = 0)

## return
    - allows you to keep a reference to what was done with a function for use later on

## for in/of loops
    - for in -> Used to loop through an object
    - for of -> Used to loop through an array

## Arrow functions -> Fun new way to write functions and save them to variables. ES6+

# Advanced DOM Manipulation - Quick Likes assignment demo

    - settimeout/setinterval
    - document.querySelectorAll()
    - element.addEventListener()
